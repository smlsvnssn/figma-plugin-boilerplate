# Randomise colour
**Randomise colour** - Premium color randomization straight outta Europe, for your viewing pleasure!

Applies colour variations to selected objects (Everything with solid fill, stroke or gradients works, including text). Great for creating an organic, handmade look, or wild patterns.

Applies variations using normal distribution, with original colour as mean, and distance setting as sigma, sometimes resulting in extreme outliers. Selected object's original colours are cached as long as the plugin is open.

**Options:**

- Hue distance from original colour
- Saturation distance from original colour
- Lightness distance from original colour
- Opacity distance from original colour
- Include fills
- Include strokes
- Include gradients
